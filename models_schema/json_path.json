String keys that start with '@' have a special meaning. @INT means any item key on the list, @STR - any object property and @ANY is a combination of STR and INT. @SKIP_LIST is designed for paths where list of many objects can be replaced with a single object. Using SKIP_LIST means that if previous key lead to a list than the INT should be applied to the path, otherwise SKIP_LIST has no effect. Every other key that starts with @ is a regular expression. String keys that don't start with '@' are normal keys of the JSON path. A rare case of a path that uses key which starts with '@' isn't taken into account in current standard."
